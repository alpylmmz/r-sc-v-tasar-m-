Two important features that make electronic devices used today stand out in the market are speed and cost. The most challenging factor for electronic devices in terms of cost is the processor, which is also an element that has a great impact on the speed of the device. Today, companies produce their own processors or use processors designed by companies experienced in this field. The lack of a common standard in the processor architecture leads companies to different processor designs for different purposes. Because of this complex and multiple structure of the processor architecture, creating and using a processor is seen as a very complex process. In recent years, the RISC-V project has been initiated to resolve this issue and develop a common standard processor design. The aim of this project is to teach the working principle of a basic processor. FPGA boards are digital integrated circuits consisting of field programmable logic blocks and inter-block links. It is one of our essentials in this project due to its wide programming areas and its purposeful use. The work done with the open source hardware ISA (Instruction Set Architecture), RISC-V has become an increasing trend in FPGA programming today. Many applications written in VHDL can be implemented to be used in FPGA, one of its architecture. We have included these applications and software in our project.
